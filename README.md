# Capstone-Part-1

# What am I trying to solve
    My goal is to make an all inclusive music app (similar to what developers did when they made imdb- international movie database). The difference is that this will be centered around individual bands/artists/groups. There is no one popular/mainstream app that music enthusists can utilize to search a band's history, pictures, previous/current/future tour dates and ticket sales, discography, trivia/fun facts, etc. Usually people will go to a band's website or wikipedia for their history, buy tickets to see them live on ticketmaster or eventbrite (where its more expensive), and then research instrument tabs (tablatures for their songs) on a totally different site. I want to combine all of this into one fluid application. 

# Who will interact with the App

    This app will be specifically for music enthusiasts and musicians who follow bands/artists closely. Many of the artists/bands will be groups that were incepted in the early 1960's and onward. The genres will include everything from rock to gospel. 

# Core functionality

    Currently I am only working on the discography, history, and pictures/videos portion of this entire app. Users will be able to search by band or individual artist. The search results will contain a link to the band(s)/artist(s) and when clicked the user will be directed to a page that contains a brief history, genre classification,  list of all albums (full-length, EP, singles, etc), band members with pics, awards/nominations, and videos/pics (in studio, tour, interviews, etc). Clicking on each album will bring user to a page with album cover/art, track listing, total length time and time of each song, release date, and label. The user could also click on a song to get a drop down and see the lyrics and play an audio clip (or just link to itunes). 

    To access all this information the user will first need to signup for an account and then login with those credentials. A header will be at the top of every page that has links to the about me, home (search page), contact us, and then a menu/hamburger icon with options of going to the tablature part of the site.

# Future enhancement

    - add option to menu/hamburger icon that gives users the ability to access the tablature part of the app. In here users will be able to search songs and find a tab for the specific instrument(s) they play, if available. They will also be able to post new tablatures and edit current ones. 

    - add tour dates and trivia to each band page.
